# Nuclear Power 

Welcome to the digital exhibition on nuclear power and weaponry. This exhibition explores the history, science, and future of nuclear power. Nuclear power is a controversial topic, but it is an important one to understand. The goal of this exhibition is to provide one with the information one needs to draw informed, unbiased conclusions on nuclear power, in order to enhance your experience of the overall Chornobyl reactor room project. We hope you enjoy the exhibition.
